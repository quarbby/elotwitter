### Ranking Twitter

We start with a seedlist of Twitter handlers, who are experts in a certain area.

We construct a list of keywords in the area as a seed list. Currently, this list is extracted from Google Trends. 

We look at the Tweets of the Expert Twitterers and match them against the seed list.

We grab the Following of the Expert Twitterers and their first few Tweets, and match them against the seed list.

We use an Elo Ranking algorithm to score the Twitterers to find Influencers for this area.

Further Work: 
- Expand keyword list via co-occurence of words 
- Web User Interface enhancements
